# Player starts at 1,1 and can only move north
# We tell the player what directions he can move to
# If he enters a direction which is not available we print not a valid direction and let him try again
# PLayer wins when he gets to the tile 3,1 and we print out Victory!

#Directions the player can move to in each tile:
# 1,1 -> N
# 1,2 -> N,E,S
# 1,3 -> E,S
# 2,1 -> N
# 2,2 -> W, S
# 2,3 -> E, W
# 3,1 -> Victory!
# 3,2 -> N,S
# 3,3 -> W,S
